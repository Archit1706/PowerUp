Also, people often Google their symptoms of illness and end up jumping to conclusions based on a simple Google search without even consulting a doctorâ€™s advice. But due to our busy lifestyle, it is difficult to visit a doctor for every small symptom. To conquer these problems, we created a Web/App to keep us up-to-date with fitness goals and health check ins.
